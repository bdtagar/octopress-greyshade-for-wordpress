Octopress Greyshade for Wordpress

This is my take on Shashank Mehta's [Greyshade theme] (https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade). I took what he did for Octopress and remade it for Wordpress. It's not perfect, but it's a pretty good start. Also, it's live now at [blog.onemonthrails.com] (http://blog.onemonthrails.com)
